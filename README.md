Emotion Recognition Using TensorFlow 🤖❤

This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. The dataset is loaded directly from the 🤗 Hugging Face datasets library, making setup and experimentation fast and easy.

Emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, AI-driven mental health tools, and user experience personalization. In this project, we train a deep learning model to classify facial images into various emotion categories using a publicly available dataset from Hugging Face.
